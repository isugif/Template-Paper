# Template-Paper
When starting a new paper this repository can be branched and all relevant issues, Epics and Milestones will be ready as a guideline.


Well this doesn't work.  I was trying to copy the Issues and Epics that you can create in zenhub but that so far doesn't work.  I will keep you posted if anything changes.
